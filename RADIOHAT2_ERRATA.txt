ERRATA!!! ERRATA!!! ERRATA!!! ERRATA!!!


Note that part number for U14 - the TLV9064 quad op amp in the bill of materials for BOTH the radiohat2_QFP and radiohat 2 layouts IS INCORRECT.

The part number shown in the BOM for the digikey part is

TLV9064IPWR, CMOS Amplifier 4 Circuit Rail-to-Rail 14-TSSOP, 296-50014-1-ND

This was the intended part, but in the wrong package footprint! A 3.90mm width is what the layout intended!

TLV9064QDRQ1	IC CMOS 4 CIRCUIT 14SOIC 	296-TLV9064QDRQ1CT-ND

was what I intended

In fact, the prototypes were built and tested using 

TLV2464IDR		IC OPAMP GP 4 CIRCUIT 14SOIC	296-10608-1-ND

Which I happened to have in stock. FOR NOW, I suggest using this part - even though it's slightly more expensive as I have done no testing with the 9064 to confirm proper behavior.

I will attempt to resolve this issue before the next board revision is published...
