			Radiohat install for Bookworm 32/64 2023-Oct-18


1. Install some useful utilities from raspbian repository

	sudo apt install wsjtx fldigi qsstv pavucontrol-qt pipx



2. unzip radiohat directory into home directory then:

	sudo apt install libncurses-dev libgpiod-dev
	cd radiohat/libradiohat ; make clean ; make
	sudo make install

   The codec will not be available until the next restart!

FOR COMPATIBILITy WITH rVNC CLIENTS (not fully secure)

	edit ~/config/wayland/config to add the line:
		relax_encryption=true

FOR GNURADIO

Note that GNURADIO is currently working very badly with Wayland and generates many
long-winded warnings during execution. It's not very compatible with BOOKWORM.

1. 	sudo apt install gnuradio

2. delete any __pycache__ directories in ~/radiohat/libradiohat/GRC and
   its subfolders

3. Open all dsp graphs (.grc files) you intend to use and correct any
   version incompatibilities in them or in their sub modules, 
   then regenerate them

4. quit gnuradio-companion and restart it.



FOR VERY OLD QUISK VERSION FROM REPOSITORY:

1. 	sudo apt install quisk

2. setup quisk to use a radio of type Softrock and browse
   to point the hardware file to:

	~/radiohat/libradiohat/QUISK/radiohat_hardware.py

3. set the various audio io selections to:

	(quisk allows shortened device names)

	alsa:USB
	alsa:USB
	alsa:Radiohat
	alsa:Radiohat
	swap the I and Q on the radio IO input configuration


FOR LATEST QUISK

1. 	sudo apt install pipx
 	sudo apt install libasound2-dev python3-dev libpython3-dev \
      		python3-usb python3-setuptools portaudio19-dev \
      		libpulse-dev libgtk-4-dev libgtk-3-dev libgtk2.0-dev \
      		libcurl4-openssl-dev

	NOTE THAT PIPX DOES NOT REQUIRE SUDO OR ROOT ACCESS

		pipx install quisk (MAY TAKE AROUND AN HOUR)
		pipx ensurepath

5. setup quisk to use a radio of type Softrock by browsing to point the
   hardware file to:

	~/radiohat/libradiohat/QUISK/radiohatpkg/radiohat_hardware.py

6. set the audio io to
	alsa:USB
	alsa:USB
	alsa:Radiohat
	alsa:Radiohat
	swap the I and Q on the radio IO input configuration


7.  If you have I2C Voltage and VSWR sensors connected to an ADS1115 ADC board with reverse=CH0,
    forward=CH2 and (battery/10)=CH2 as described in vfo.cpp, then browse in the 
    Quisk radio configuration to set the widgets file to point to:
 
	~/radiohat/libradiohat/QUISK/radiohatpkg/widgets_tx.py


FOR BEST RESULTS WITH RadioHat 0.9/1.0 boards and Quisk

1. REMOVE C6 and C7
2. CHANGE R3,R4,R7,R8 to 0 ohm jumpers
3. CHANGE R11,R12 to 5.1K
4. Use a generic USB audio interface for microphone and headphone
